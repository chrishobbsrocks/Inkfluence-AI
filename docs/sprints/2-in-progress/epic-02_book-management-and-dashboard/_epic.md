# Epic 2: Book Management and Dashboard

## Overview

Build the book management data layer and the main dashboard UI. This is the user's home base — where they see all their books, track progress, and create new projects. The dashboard provides the primary entry point for all book creation workflows.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Book CRUD operations working (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Book status management (Draft → Writing → Review → Published)
- [ ] Dashboard displays book grid with progress indicators per wireframe
- [ ] Stats cards showing total books, published, in progress, downloads
- [ ] New Book creation flow functional
- [ ] Filter and sort capabilities
