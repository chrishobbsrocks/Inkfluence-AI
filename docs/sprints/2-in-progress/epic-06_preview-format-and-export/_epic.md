- [ ] 4 templates: Modern, Classic, Minimal, Bold
- [ ] Table of contents auto-generation
- [ ] Cover design (upload or AI placeholder)
- [ ] Font, size, and margin controls
- [ ] PDF export with template styling
- [ ] EPUB export for e-readers
- [ ] MOBI export for Kindle
- [ ] Download functionality for all formats
- [ ] Preview UI matches wireframe

## Key Technical Challenges

- PDF generation with proper typography and layout
- EPUB format compliance for e-reader compatibility
- Template system that produces consistent output across formats
- Cover image integration into export files
